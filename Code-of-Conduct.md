# BetaNYC’s Code of Conduct
Our activities and events should foster meaningful collaboration between participants, community members, and government partners. We expect internal governance, participants, advocacy, activities, and events to be:

1. Provide a safe, respectful, and welcoming environment where all are free to fully express their ideas and identities free from discrimination or harassment. All spaces, online or physical, shall be governed by BetaNYC’s anti-harassment policy.
1. Default to open and work to be objective.
1. Collaborate for the purpose of generating ideas that empower, innovate, and develop local capacity.
1. Presume the value of others and cherish everyone’s ideas, skills, and contributions.
1. Encourage participants to listen as much as they speak, ask respectful questions, and demystify context.
1. Foster energy that builds “yes, and” ideas and permit the ability to stretch. 
1. Build ideas, tools, and platforms that are open and free for reuse. Activities should prioritize public use, not private gain.
1. Work to prioritize access for and input from those who are traditionally excluded from the civic process, be inclusive of all Boroughs, and be considerate of our Hudson River neighbors.
1. Actively involve stakeholders, community groups, and those with subject matter expertise in all decision-making processes.
1. Ensure that relationships and conversations between, and among, stakeholders e.g. elected officials, their staff, and government representatives, community based organizations and their partners, and members of the BetaNYC community — remain respectful, participatory, and productive.

BetaNYC reserves the right to ask anyone in violation of these policies not to participate in BetaNYC’s events or network of activities. If you have any other concerns or would like to address an issue, please contact Noel Hidalgo, BetaNYC’s Executive Director, at noel@betaNYC.us or email the membership committee at members@betaNYC.us.

BetaNYC’s Code of Conduct is an adaptation of [Code for America’s Community Code of Conduct policy](https://github.com/codeforamerica/codeofconduct). BetaNYC agrees to review this policy annually and have it voted on by members in good standing.
