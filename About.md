About BetaNYC

#BetaNYC is building a connected New York City by the people, for the people, for 21st Century.

We are NYC’s civic technology and open government vanguard. Since 2009, we have worked with elected officials to engage NYC’s technology community. We have helped pass transformative open government legislation, and have supported NYC’s civic oriented startups. 

BetaNYC is an organizing force for local civic engagement - we are a network of civic-minded volunteers who contribute their skills toward digital platforms for local government and community service.
