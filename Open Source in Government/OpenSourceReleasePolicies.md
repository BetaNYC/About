* '''United States of America''': Open Source Release Policies are somewhat complex at the federal level, but David Wheeler has created a helpful guide, [http://www.groklaw.net/article.php?story=20110906101834630 Publicly Releasing Open Source Software Developed for the U.S. Government] - ''This article summarizes when the U.S. federal government or its contractors may publicly release, as open source software (OSS), software developed with government funds. This section is intended for non-lawyers, to help them understand the basic rules they must follow.''
* '''UK''': ''Government departments, who now have delegated authority from the Controller to license their software and source code using open source licences, and other public sector bodies that are involved in developing their own software and source code are encouraged to make their software and source code available as openly as possible. This requires a flexible approach to licensing. Developers in the public sector may choose to release their software and source code under the Open Government Licence. Alternatively, the Open Source Initiative maintains a list of approved open source licences covering software and source code that developers in the public sector can use.'' - [http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/information-management/government-licensing/licensing-software.htm UK Policy for licensing source code]
