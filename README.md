## About BetaNYC
=====

BetaNYC is building a connected New York City by the people, for the people, for 21st Century.

Founded in 2008 as a meetup to discuss open government in NYC, we has evolved to be a key local leader and national partner in civic technology, open data, and open government.

BetaNYC is an organizing force for local civic engagement - we are a network of civic-minded volunteers who contribute their skills toward digital platforms for local government and community service.
